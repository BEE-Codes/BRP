                         There are lots of good reasons why more than
                        half of Australians now use a  broker to secure a home loan. 
                        Probably the most important one that is we  work for you, not the banks. 
                        We speak to you first to find out what you  need, and then we use our knowledge of 
                        the market to better negotiate  with the lenders.
                        Then we get a range of options before we work out which  one is right for you, not 
                        what is right for the lenders.

                        the right solution.
                        And just to make things even easier, we will do the paperwork, manage the 
                        application process and then take it through to settlement. 
                        Best of all, because this is what we specialise in, we get the process moving 
                        quickly. We use our relationships with lenders to secure your finance as fast as 
                        possible.
